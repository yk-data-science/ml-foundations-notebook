# Statistics for Machine Learning

This folder contains materials and code related to statistical methods commonly used in machine learning workflows. 

## Contents

- **Basic Statistics:** Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, variance, and distribution analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Statistical techniques used in data cleaning, outlier detection, and imputation.
- **Statistical Testing:** Hypothesis testing methods like t-tests and chi-square tests to validate assumptions.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Introduction to techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Statistical metrics for model performance evaluation, including error measurements.

## Usage

Each Jupyter notebook includes explanations and code examples demonstrating how to apply these statistical concepts in real machine learning projects.
